# PVNet for Wind and PV Sites in India

## PVNet for sites

### Data

We use PV generation data for India from April 2019-Nov 2022 for training
and Dec 2022- Nov 2023 for validation. This is only with ECMWF data, and PV generation history.

The forecast is every 15 minutes for 48 hours for PV generation.

The input NWP data is hourly, and 32x32 pixels (corresponding to around 320kmx320km) around a central
point in NW-India.

### Results

Overall MAE is 4.9% on the validation set, and forecasts look overall good.

## WindNet


### April-29-2024 WindNet v1 Production Model

[WandB Link](https://wandb.ai/openclimatefix/india/runs/5llq8iw6)

Improvements: Larger input size (64x64), 7 hour delay for ECMWF NWP inputs, to match productions.
New, much more efficient encoder for NWP, allowing for more filters and layers, with less parameters.
The 64x64 input size corresponds to 6.4 degrees x 6.4 degrees, which is around 700km x 700km. This allows for the
model to see the wind over the wind generation sites, which seems to be the biggest reason for the improvement in the model.



MAE is 7.6% with real improvements on the production side of things.


There were other experiments with slightly different numbers of filters, model parameters and the like, but generally no
improvements were seen.


## WindNet v1 Results

### Data

We use Wind generation data for India from April 2019-Nov 2022 for training
and Dec 2022- Nov 2023 for validation. This is only with ECMWF data, and Wind generation history.

The forecast is every 15 minutes for 48 hours for Wind generation.

The input NWP data is hourly, and 32x32 pixels (corresponding to around 320kmx320km) around a central
point in NW-India. Note: The majority of the wind generation is likely not covered in the 320kmx320km area.

MAE is around 10% overall, although it doesn't seem to do very well on the ramps up and down.
