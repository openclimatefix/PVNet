<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is/does. -->
## Model Description

<!-- e.g.
This model class uses satellite data, and numerical weather predictions to forecast the near-term (up to 8 hours ahead) PV power output at all Grid Service Points (GSPs) in Great Britain. More information can be found in the model repo [1]. The model repo also includes links to our workshop paper on this model and some experimental notes.

# Training Details

## Data

<!-- eg.
The model is trained on data from 2019-2022 and validated on data from 2022-2023. It uses NWP data from ECMWF IFS model, and the UK Met Office UKV model. It uses satellite data from the EUMETSAT MSG SEVIRI instrument.

See the data_config.yaml file for more information on the channels and window-size used for each input data source.

<!-- The preprocessing section is not strictly nessessary but perhaps nice to have -->
### Preprocessing

<!-- eg.
Data is prepared with the `ocf_data_sampler/torch_datasets/datasets/pvnet_uk` Dataset [2].
